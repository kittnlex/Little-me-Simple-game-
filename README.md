# Little-me-Simple-game-
"Little World" is a game about a character (me) walking around a green field collecting coins!

👉 The goal is simple: move your character around the screen and collect coins to earn points. Each time you grab a coin, a new one appears in a random spot, challenging you to keep going.

## ✨ Features

- Character movement with keyboard arrow keys
- Collision detection to collect coins
- Score counter that updates in real-time
- A custom start screen alert box that welcomes you into the game
- Clean beginner-friendly code structure

## 🛠️ What I Learned

This project helped me understand:

- DOM manipulation with JavaScript
- getBoundingClientRect() for collision detection
- Event listeners for keyboard input
- Basic CSS styling and positioning
- How to plan and organize a game loop
